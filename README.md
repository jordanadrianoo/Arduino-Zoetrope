# Arduino Zoetrope

This arduino project is inspired by the "Arduino Projects Book" project 10 by Scogg Fitzgerald and Michael Shiloh. This project uses a 9-volt battery to spin a platform to replicate a zoetrope. By using rotational speed and controlling the amount of light exposure, the images on the pltform look like they are moving.
